# The-LEGO-Project

This is a totally scratch project--as in no ideas or methods were taken from anyone else as to how to go about analyzing this database of LEGOs. I started with my own questions, and found
my own answers. It is a more complicated data set to work with, as each table only has a few columns, but there are many tables, with many that do not share a common field, so connecting them is a bit of a challenge. I started with the Sets and Themes tables as I think this is what most people think of when they think LEGOs--their favorite sets and the themes they are a part of, such as Harry Potter. Now I've added the main inventory tables to get more specific part information to go along with the Sets. But there is a lot of data here, so more will follow, as this database by Rebrickable was actually compiled to help people figure out 
what sets they could build with any number of given parts, so all manner of part details and inventories can be found within. 

Also a cool Tableau dashboard on the subject can be found here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092 for further perusing. Thanks for checking it out!
