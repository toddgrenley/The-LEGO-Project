# The-LEGO-Project

This is my first scratch project--no ideas or methods were taken from anyone else as to how to analyze this database of LEGO parts and sets originally put together by 
Rebrickable. I started with my own questions, and found my own answers.

This database, like many, has numerous tables with only a few columns each, so I make use of Joins and Temp Tables galore. I started with the Sets and Themes tables as I think 
this is what most people think of when they think LEGOs--their favorite sets and the themes they are a part of, such as Harry Potter. Now I've added the Main Inventory tables 
to get more specific part information to go along with the Sets. But there is a lot of data here, so more will follow, as this database by Rebrickable was actually compiled to 
help people figure out what sets they could build with any number of given parts, so all manner of part details and inventories can be found within.

Also my Tableau dashboard on the subject can be found here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/todd3092/viz/LEGOProject_16730768558980/Dashboard2 for further perusing. 
Thanks for checking it out!
