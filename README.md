# The-LEGO-Project

This is a scratch project--no ideas or methods were taken from anyone else as to how to analyze this database of LEGO parts and sets originally put together by 
Rebrickable. I started with my own questions, and found many interesting answers.

This database, like many, has many tables with only a few columns each, so I make use of Joins and Temp Tables galore. I started with the Sets and Themes tables as 
I think this is what most people think of when they think LEGOs--their favorite sets and the themes they are a part of, such as Harry Potter. Now I've added the Main 
Inventory tables to get more specific part information to go along with the Sets. But there is a lot of data here, so more will follow, as this database by Rebrickable 
was actually compiled to help people figure out what sets they could build with any number of given parts, so all manner of part details and inventories can be found 
within.

Some interesting finds so far...

Releases peaked in 2017 with 713 new sets.

Close to 2 million pieces would be needed to build all the sets in LEGO's inventory.

The ubiquitous "Brick 1x2" is the most used piece--almost 70,000 times throughout all sets!
