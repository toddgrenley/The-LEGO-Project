# The-LEGO-Project

This is a scratch project--as in no ideas or methods were taken from anyone else as to how to go about analyzing the LEGO database. I started with my own questions, and found
my own answers. And it is a more complicated data set to work with, as each table only has a few columns, but there are many tables, with many that do not share a common field, 
so connecting them is a bit of a challenge. At the moment I've only used the Sets and Themes tables as I think this is what most people think of when they think LEGOS--their 
favorite sets and the themes they are a part of, such as Harry Potter. But more will follow, as this database by Rebrickable was actually compiled to help people figure out 
what sets they could build with any number of given parts, so all manner of part details and inventories can be found within.
